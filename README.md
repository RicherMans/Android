<h1>Introduction</h1>
I hate touching through multiple folders etc. just for playing music. 
Also I hate to reorganize my music every time when transferring music onto the device.
That's why i made this app, which does not play actual music, but generates playlists to use for 
music players.


<h1>What does it?</h1>
GentlePlayer is a totally simple Playlist generator for your Android device. 

Just install it and start it once. Playlists will be created on the fly.

<h1>Usage</h1>

<ul TYPE="CIRCLE">

<li>Connect your device to your Computer</li>
<li>Copy your music into the SDCard </li>
<li>Disconnect from Computer</li>
<li>Voil√† , your music is now listed as a playlist in your default android music player and other players</li>
</ul>
