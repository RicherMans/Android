Hey there, this is GentlePlayer.

GentlePlayer is a totally simple Playlist generator for your Android device. 
I love the easy and intuitive Android standard music player, but its nearly impossible to manage multiple folders with it.
So i wrote this little app, which just generates new playlists depending on all folders, which contain one or more audio files.


<h1>Usage</h1>

<ul TYPE="CIRCLE">
<li>Start the app once. ( No GUI will appear, just s short message that it is started)</li>
<li>Connect your device to your Computer</li>
<li>Copy your music into the SDCard </li>
<li>Disconnect from Computer</li>
<li>Voil√† , your music is now listed as a playlist in your default android music player and other players</li>
</ul>
