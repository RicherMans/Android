Hey there, this is GentlePlayer.

GentlePlayer is a totally simple Playlist generator for your Android device. 
I love the easy and intuitive Android standard music player, but its nearly impossible to manage multiple folders with it.
So i wrote this little app, which just generates new playlists depending on all folders, which contain one or more audio files.


1. Install app.
2. Start the app once. ( No GUI will appear, just s short message that it is started)
3. Connect your device to your Computer
4. Copy your music into the SDCard 
5. Disconnect from Computer
6. Voil√† , your music is now listed as a playlist in your default android music player
